    <h1>Universal Credits</h1>
    <p>Oracle Universal Credits provide a predictable, consistent way to pay for any Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) service in any region,<sup>*</sup> including future releases of cloud services. Credits are debited as you use OCI services over the course of a year, giving you the flexibility to ramp up your workloads.</p>

    <h2>Using Universal Credits</h2>
    <div class="usage-content">
      <div class="usage-text">
        <p>The Universal Credit model is the most flexible buying and consumption model for Oracle Cloud Infrastructure services.</p>
        <p>There are two ways to purchase OCI services from Oracle: (i) Pay As You Go (PAYG) and (ii) the Universal Credit annual commitment model.</p>
        <p>Credits can be applied to eligible services at any time in any OCI region.<sup>*</sup></p>
        <p>Actual OCI service usage is debited from the customer's contractual amount of Universal Credits. Unused credits expire after the contract term ends.</p>
